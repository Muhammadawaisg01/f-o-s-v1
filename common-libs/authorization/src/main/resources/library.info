This library provides 'UserContextFilter' extending  Spring's 'OncePerRequestFilter'.
This filter fetches user claims from access JWT token and fills 'UserContextHolder'.
Default implementation of 'UserContextHolder' contains user ID and has scope 'request'.

To use it just inject 'UserContextHolder' into your component and call: UserContextHolder#getId()
